Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning and NLP
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Sentiment Analysis model using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model classifies text data (e.g., product reviews, customer feedback) into different sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral.

Key Features:
1.Text data preprocessing using NLP techniques.
2.Vectorization of text data using TF-IDF.
3.Machine Learning model (Random Forest Classifier) for sentiment classification.
4.Model evaluation using key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
